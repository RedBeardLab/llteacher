# User Workflows Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the user workflows in LLTeacher, examining how teachers and students interact with the system, identifying pain points, and highlighting areas for improvement in the redesign.

## Teacher Workflows

### 1. Teacher Onboarding

**Current Flow:**
1. Teacher registers/logs in
2. System automatically creates Teacher profile

### 4. Student Progress Review

**Current Flow:**
1. Teacher clicks on homework to view details
2. System shows list of student submissions
3. Teacher can click on submissions to view conversations
4. Teacher reviews conversation history
5. Teacher provides feedback and grades

**Issues:**

- Subjective grading without clear criteria

### 5. Teacher Testing

**Current Flow:**
1. Teacher creates "test submission" for their homework
2. System creates conversation for teacher testing
3. Teacher can interact with LLM to test guidance quality
4. Teacher can refine homework/solution based on testing

**Issues:**

- No progress indicators
- All homeworks visible regardless of relevance

**Pain Points:**
- Difficult to find relevant assignments
- No way to prioritize work
- Overwhelming choice without guidance

### 3. Submission Creation

**Current Flow:**
1. Student clicks on homework
2. System checks if submission exists
3. If no submission, redirects to create submission
4. Student creates submission (no fields required)
5. System creates conversation automatically
6. Student is redirected to conversation

**Issues:**
- Multiple redirects and state changes
- No explanation of what submission means
- Automatic conversation creation may be confusing

- Immediate jump into AI interaction

### 4. AI Tutoring Interaction

**Current Flow:**
1. Student enters conversation interface
2. Student types questions or requests help
3. LLM responds using teacher's solution as guidance
4. Student can ask follow-up questions
5. Student can execute R code if needed
6. Conversation continues until student is satisfied

**Issues:**
- No guidance on effective questioning
- No progress tracking within conversation
- R code execution is hardcoded (not generic)
- No way to save work or take breaks

**Pain Points:**
- Students may not know how to ask good questions
- No sense of progress or completion
- Limited programming language support
- Conversations can become very long

### 5. Assignment Submission

**Current Flow:**
1. Student indicates they want to submit
2. System changes submission status to "submitted"
3. Conversation becomes read-only
4. Teacher can review and grade

**Issues:**
- No final review before submission
- No way to revise after submission
